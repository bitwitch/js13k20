Elevator pitch:
A platformer/puzzle game where you solve levels by interacting with terminals
and hacking the space around you in order to reach an exit.



Freeflowing ideas about this game:
- It takes place in cyberspace, maybe in some sort of maintenance tunnel which
  explains why there are terminals everywhere that allow you some level of
  access to procedures that control the cyberspace around you

- I want to explore some meta concepts. The commands the player runs in the
  terminals will run gamecode that affects the game itself

- Its also sort of meta in the sense that the player character is exposed to
  some sense of the creation of the world around them

- An important aspect of the puzzle is the last output on the terminal, it may
  show Errors or maybe just information about the last tasks performed. All of
  this information is useful to the player for figuring out what they are
  capable of with the terminal. They can combine this 'last output' information
  with their own creative ideas in order to solve the level's puzzle and reach
  the exit.




Within terminals, you will be able to:
- See the last output from the system (this can hint at how to solve the level.
- enter commands with arguments that execute procedures altering the game world
- be able to run actual gamecode procedures at runtime using the terminal
